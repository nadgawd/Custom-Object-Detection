# Custom Object Detection Model

## Overview

This repository contains a custom object detection model implemented in Python using OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow. The model has been tested with three different architectures: EfficientDet D4, RCNN Inception ResNet V2, and SSD MobileNet V2.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide a versatile and easily deployable custom object detection model, capable of accurately identifying objects in images using state-of-the-art architectures. The model is designed to offer flexibility by supporting distinct architectures like: EfficientDet D4, RCNN Inception ResNet V2, and SSD MobileNet V2. Users can seamlessly integrate this object detection solution into their projects or use it as a standalone tool.

## Features

- **Multiple Architectures**: The model supports various popular object detection architectures like EfficientDet D4, RCNN Inception ResNet V2, and SSD MobileNet V2.

- **Easy Integration**: The codebase is designed to be easily integrated into existing projects or used as a standalone object detection solution.

- **Dependency Management**: The model relies on widely-used Python libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow, making it easy to manage dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow

## Performance

- **SSD MobileNet V2**: It detected less objects with less confidence.
- **EfficientDet D4**: Detected more objects but the confidence was still low.
- **RCNN Inception ResNet V2**: Detected less objects but with higher confidence.
